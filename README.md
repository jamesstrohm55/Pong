# Pong Game

A simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle graphics library.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Controls for both players
- Simple physics for the ball movement
- Minimalistic design using Turtle graphics

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – The main programming language used for the game logic and mechanics.
- **Turtle** – A Python library used for creating graphics and handling user input, ideal for simple games like Pong.
- **Git** – Version control system used for managing the code and repository.

## Skill Stack

The following skills are utilized in the development of this Pong game:

- **Game Development** – Understanding the core mechanics of games (physics, movement, controls, etc.).
- **Python Programming** – Writing the game logic, including player movement, ball physics, and collision detection.
- **Turtle Graphics** – Using the Turtle library for rendering game elements (paddles, ball, and scores) on the screen.
- **Debugging and Optimization** – Troubleshooting issues related to game mechanics and optimizing performance.
- **Version Control with Git** – Using Git to manage code changes and collaborate (if applicable).

## Getting Started
